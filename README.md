### Hey, I'm Kevin! 👋
<img align = "right" src = "code.png" width = "240">

I'm a senior at the University of Pennsylvania studying Computer Science 👨‍💻 and Mathematical Economics 📊.  I'm interested in the use of computation, data, and technology for social good.

This past summer, I worked as a Software Engineer Intern at Palantir and have recently TA'd for Penn courses on algorithmic game theory and blockchain.  In previous internships, I've done software engineering at Creci, a fintech startup that launched a social impact investing platform, and data science with the Miami Department of Innovation and Technology (DoIT) via Coding it Forward's Civic Innovation Corps program.

At Penn, I'm part of Public Interest Tech @ Penn and Penn Climate Ventures, where I work to promote tech applications for the public good and climate respectively.  Previously, I've also been a Project Lead for Global Research and Consulting (GRC) and the VP of Innovation for Marketing Undergraduate Student Establishment (MUSE).
