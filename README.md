### Hey, I'm Kevin! 👋🏼
<img align = "right" src = "graphic.png" width = "240">

I'm a freshman at the University of Pennsylvania studying Computer Science 👨‍💻.  I'm interested in the ways in which computation and data can be used to promote sustainable development and social impact.

I'm an Associate Consultant for [Global Research and Consulting](https://www.grcglobalgroup.com/), and will be working with GRC Kellogg (Northwestern) on a data analytics project this semester.  I am also revamping the website for [Ideas for Action](https://ideas4action.org/), an organization promoting sustainable development to young people through competitions and events.

Currently, I'm focused on becoming more proficient in various data analysis and visualization tools using Python and R.  I am also learning more about machine learning and its potential applications to address real-world issues.
