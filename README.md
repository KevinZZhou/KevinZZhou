### Hey, I'm Kevin! 👋🏼
<img align = "right" src = "code.png" width = "240">

I'm a freshman at the University of Pennsylvania studying Computer Science 👨‍💻.  I'm interested in the ways in which computation and data can be used to promote sustainable development and social impact.

I'm an Associate Consultant for [Global Research and Consulting](https://www.grcglobalgroup.com/) and am currently working with GRC Kellogg (Northwestern University) on a client-facing data analytics project this semester.  I am also revamping the website for [Ideas for Action](https://ideas4action.org/), an organization that advocates for sustainable development to young people through competitions and events.

At the moment, I'm focused on becoming more proficient in various data analysis, machine learning, and visualization tools using Python and R.
