### Hey, I'm Kevin! 👋
<img align = "right" src = "code.png" width = "240">

I'm a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania studying Computer 
Science 👨‍💻. I'm interested in the use of computation, data, and 
technology for social good in various domains.

This past summer, I interned at the Miami Department of Innovation 
and Technology (DoIT) doing data science work as a member of the 
Civic Innovation Corps, a program connecting young technologists to 
civic tech opportunities.

At Penn, I'm a Project Lead for Global Research and Consulting (GRC) 
and Penn Climate Ventures (PCV), a Software Developer at Penn Spark, 
and I'm part of the board at Public Interest Tech @ Penn.
