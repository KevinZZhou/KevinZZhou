### Hey, I'm Kevin! 👋
<img align = "right" src = "code.png" width = "240">

I'm a rising sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania studying Computer 
Science 👨‍💻. I'm interested in the use of computation, data, and technology for 
social good in various domains.

For example, I'm very excited about the profound benefit to the public interest 
that technology can create in government through civic tech initiatives.  
Currently, I'm a Data Science intern at the Miami Department of Innovation and Technology (DoIT) as a member of the Civic Innovation Corps, a program designed 
to connect young technologists to civic tech opportunities.  At Penn, I'm also 
a member of PIT@Penn, a student organization focused on promoting public 
interest tech initiatives on campus.
